# TIR-Caluclator
Tiered Interest Rate Calculator in Excel.
To apply a tiered interest rate, we need some range of amounts with different interest rates. Each will create a single tier. Then, providing your account balance will check which tier it falls under. After that, you will get the value of the tiered interest. You can use them as a calculator further by just giving your preferred Account Balance value.
